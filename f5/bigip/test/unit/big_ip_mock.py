    Mocks a BIG-IPÂ® object by substituting a mock icr_session object which
    returns a user created mock response object. To use, create a mock response
    object which will get returned by any icr_session HTTP method, then create
    an interface object, passing in this BIG-IPMock object.

    Example:

        # Create a mock response object with status code and JSON. Here
        # read_json_file() is used to get mock JSON, but you can always pass
        # in a JSON string, or create a dictionary object and convert to JSON
        # using json.loads().
