'''The classes within define the management of a cluster of BIG_IP devices.

Definitions:
    Cluster: The manager of the TrustDomain and DeviceGroup objects.
    TrustDomain: a group of BIG-IP® devices that have exchanged certificates
                 and trust one another
    DeviceGroup: a group of BIG-IP® device that sync configuration data and
                 failover connections.

Clustering is broken down into three component parts: a cluster manager, a
trust domain, and a device group. The cluster manager presents the external
interface to a user for operations like create, teardown etc....

To create a device service group (aka cluster) of devices, those devices
must trust one another. This is coordinated by the TrustDomain class. Once
those devices trust one another, a device group is created and each is added
to the group. After this step, a cluster exists.

Currently the only supported type of cluster is a 'sync-failover' cluster.
The number of devices supported officially is currently two, for an
active-standby cluster, but the code below can accommodate a four-member
cluster.

Methods:

    * create -- creates a cluster based on kwargs given by user
    * teardown -- tears down an existing cluster

Examples:

There are two major use-cases here:

    * Manage an existing cluster:

        list_of_bigips = [ManagementRoot(...), ManagementRoot(...)]
        cluster_mgr = ClusterManager(
                            devices=list_of_bigips,
                            device_group_name='my_cluster',
                            device_group_type='sync-failover',
                            device_group_partition='Common'
                        )
        assert cluster_mgr.cluster.devices == list_of_bigips

    * Create a new cluster and manage it:

        list_of_bigips = [ManagementRoot(...), ManagementRoot(...)]
        cluster_mgr = ClusterManager()
        cluster_mgr.create(
                    devices=list_of_bigips,
                    device_group_name='my_cluster',
                    device_group_type='sync-failover',
                    device_group_partition='Common
                )
        assert cluster_mgr.cluster.devices == list_of_bigips
