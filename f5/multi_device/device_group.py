'''Class for managing a DeviceGroup for a set of BIG-IPÂ® devices

Managing a device group for clustering is an event-driven process. Please
use the methods here to control that process. The fundamental idea is that
any action should have an observable outcome. Adding a device to the device
group should have a consequence for each member of the device group,
including the newly added member.

Examples:

There are two major use-cases here:

    * Manage an existing device group:

        list_of_bigips = [ManagementRoot(...), ManagementRoot(...)]
        device_group = DeviceGroup(
                            devices=list_of_bigips,
                            device_group_name='my_cluster',
                            device_group_type='sync-failover',
                            device_group_partition='Common'
                        )
        device_group.ensure_all_devices_in_sync()

    * Create a new device group and manage it:

        list_of_bigips = [ManagementRoot(...), ManagementRoot(...)]
        device_group = DeviceGroup()
        device_group.create(
                        devices=list_of_bigips,
                        device_group_name='my_cluster',
                        device_group_type='sync-failover',
                        device_group_partition='Common'
                    )
        device_group.ensure_all_devices_in_sync()

Methods:

    * create -- create a device group from a list of devices
    * teardown -- teardown a device group, but leave the trust domain intact
    * validate -- ensure a device group is in the proper state based on inputs
    * manage_extant -- manage an existing device group

    '''Class to manage device service group

    For the non-public methods, there are a few flavors of behavior:
    get, check, and ensure. A 'get' retrieves some info from the device
    without any assumptions about that info. A 'check' will assert a device's
    info is as expected. An 'ensure' method often does one or more of the
    above and also may take some other action to enforce the expected state,
    such as syncing config.

    The pollster is used heavliy here for 'check' and 'get' methods, since we
    are often waiting for the device or devices to respond to some action.

    Example:

        * dg = self._get_device_group()
        * self._check_all_devices_in_sync()
        * self.ensure_all_devices_in_sync()
