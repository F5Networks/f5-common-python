User Guide
==========
To get the most out of using our SDK, it's useful to understand the basic
concepts and principals we used when we designed it. It is also important
that you are familiar with the F5® BIG-IP® and, at a minimum, how to configure BIG-IP®
using the configuration utility (the GUI). More useful still would be if you are already familiar with the `iControl® REST API <https://devcentral.f5.com/wiki/iControlREST
.HomePage.ashx>`_.
