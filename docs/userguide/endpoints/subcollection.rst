Subcollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``kind``: ``collectionstate``

A subcollection is a |Collection| that's attached to a higher-level |Resource| object. Subcollections are almost exactly the same as collections; the exception is that they can only be accessed via the resource they're attached to (the 'parent' resource). A subcollection can be identified by the value ``isSubcollection: true``, followed by an ``items`` attribute listing the subcollection's resources. Just as with collections, you can use :meth:`~f5.bigip.resource.Collection.get_collection` to get a list of the resources in the subcollection.

.. _subcollection_example:

.. topic:: Example

   A ``pool`` resource has a ``members_s`` subcollection attached to it; you must create or load the 'parent' resource (``pool``) before you can access the subcollection (``members_s``).

   >>> from f5.bigip import BigIP
   >>> bigip = BigIP('192.168.1.1', 'myuser', 'mypass')
   >>> pool = bigip.ltm.pools.pool.load(partition='Common', name='p1')
   >>> members = pool.members_s.get_collection()

.. note::

   In the above example, the subcollection object -- ``members_s`` -- ends
   in ``_s`` because the subcollection resource object name  (``members``)
   is already plural.


The JSON returned for a pool with one member is shown below. Note the
highlighted rows, which indicate the subcollection.
